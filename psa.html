    Inevitably someone will approach you with one or both of these offers, and I want you to know in advance what they
    gain from it and why it probably isn't in your best interest. Newer players will be affected by these the most.

<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Loss Selling</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Attacking someone and losing intentionally is worth a certain amount of money, usually 300K-400K each. Even at these
    prices I don't consider it worth it, unless you just do it a couple times for a Xanax to attack with. But it gets
    worse, if you're a new player people are going to spam mail you offering you as low as 50k-100k. If you REALLY want to
    sell losses, find reputable buyers on the
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-cyan);"><a style="color: var(--te-text-color-cyan);" href="/forums.php#/p=forums&amp;f=59&amp;b=0&amp;a=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span
                style="color: var(--te-text-color-blue);">attacking forum</span></a></span>
    and accept no less than 300k each.

<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Faction Poachers</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    It's not uncommon for other factions to try to "poach" members and get them to switch. Sometimes this is genuine
    interest, but 90% of the time there is a reason they can't get anyone to join and have resorted to poaching. This is
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> me trying to get you to stay, this is me trying to keep you
    informed that these people are not genuinely interested in you. If you want to go to a warring faction, that's totally
    fine, but please don't join one of these trash cache farms that will take advantage of you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You might not have the stat estimates you see here, and it might not be as obvious as this, but here's an example of
    what a cache farm looks like. Notice the massive level difference between the top end and low end. This is
    intentional, these factions know there is a massive stat gap, and that you won't be able to make many hits, leaving
    most of the pot for them.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    And here is about what you can expect if you join one of these with low stats. Keep in mind most factions pay per hit,
    and take a certain % off the top before any payout. Some factions may have a normal stat range, but will then have a
    terrible payout %. 80/20 is the standard, but some factions pay as high as 90% or even 100% of the pot to members.
