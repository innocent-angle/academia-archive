</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Leveling is important. It opens up flying at level 15, as a great early income source. It also gives you more life,
    and access to purchase merits in the point shop every 2 levels. The fastest way to level is by attacking people, with
    higher levels giving more XP. Use one of the links below to build a "chain list" of people who aren't active and you
    can defeat. You can add these people to your targets list for easy access.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Train until you have ~500-1000 stats</li>
    <li style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">
        <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">Grab a Proficience (bonus XP) weapon from the armory</span>
    </li>
    <li style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">
        <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">Use all (or most)&nbsp;of your energy hitting inactive leveling targets</span>
    </li>
    <li style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">
        <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">Put the Proficience weapon back so other people can use it.</span>
    </li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach level 15.</li>
    <li>Once you reach level 15 switch back to training.</li>
</ol>

    Optionally, you can choose to hold your level. It is generally agreed that level holding is not worth it, but it will
    make you appear weaker and maybe get you some defends. Some people agree that your hall of fame &ldquo;level&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;battle stat&rdquo; ranks should be similar to avoid being used as a leveling target, so you may wish to
    consider that as well.

    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">DO NOT farm active players</span>. There are countless inactives in the
    lists below perfect for leveling. If you ignore this warning and get retaliated on, we will not help you, and if it
    becomes a problem for us as a faction you will be kicked. The last thing you want to do as a new player is create
    enemies for yourself, because it costs almost nothing to keep you in the hospital 24/7 and there is almost nothing you
    can do about it.
