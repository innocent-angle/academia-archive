<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Each type of drug will give you a different level of addiction. Addiction effects occur while you have a particular
    level of addiction - not just while you have a drug cooldown. Every drug you take will provide <i>some</i> addiction
    (unless you are reading the "Hot Turkey"
    <a title="Books" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Books" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> book</a>), even if the Brain
    icon has not yet appeared. It is important to note that while the terms are often used interchangeably in Torn,
    "Addiction" and "Battle Stats debuff" are <i>not</i> the same thing - although this debuff is an easy way to gauge
    your level of addiction without going to rehab.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    At a certain level of addiction, the brain icon will appear among your personal icons, indicating the level of debuff
    to your Battle Stats. The heavier your addiction, the more red the brain will appear.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Aside from a Battle Stats debuff, additional negative consequences will begin to occur as your addiction progresses:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your effectiveness within a company will begin to drop (this does not affect directors). This starts from your first
        drug, not just when the Brain icon has appeared! When you click on your information in your company you will see
        your addiction amount. Different company types and directors are more strict on keeping addiction levels low.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will be kicked from any education you are enrolled in. While in a faction with maximum Toleration, this occurs
        around an addiction level that provides 6-7% Battle Stats debuff. This effect can be mitigated working in a 10*
        <a title="Nightclub" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Nightclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightclub</a>. It
        has occasionally happened as low as brain icon 5% when the brain first goes from black to red.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may lose access to the drug-free
        <a title="Gym" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Gym" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gym</a>, the Sports Science Lab.
        This occurs if your total Xanax and Ecstasy used combines to more than 150.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may be forced to use drugs to be able to access the Gym to train in; if you have high addiction and try to train
        you may fail to train if you don&rsquo;t have an active drug icon.
    </li>
</ul>

    <li>
        Although rumoured for years, Addiction <i>does not</i> affect Organised Crimes success in any way.

    It is possible to&nbsp;<a title="Addiction Mitigation" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Addiction_Mitigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mitigate</a>
    the effects of addiction with:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The "Side Effects" Faction special.</li>
    <li>The "Addiction Mitigation" Merit upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible to remove these long-term effects by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Going to Rehab in
        <a title="Switzerland" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switzerland</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Waiting for the addiction to wear off naturally. 20 Addiction Points are removed naturally each day at 3:30am TCT.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spending job points on specials: "R and R" in
        <a title="Cruise Line Agency" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Cruise_Line_Agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cruise Line Agency</a>, "Herbal Cleansing" in
        <a title="Flower Shop" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Flower_Shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flower Shop</a>,
        and "Suppression" in
        <a title="Nightclub" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/Nightclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightclub</a> (all
        of which are available in 5* companies). 1 Addiction Point is removed per job point.
    </li>
    <li>Using Book&nbsp;: Milk Yourself Sober which removes a substantial amount of drug addiction upon completion.</li>
    <li>Using Book&nbsp;: Hot Turkey to gain no drug addiction 31 days.</li>
    <li>
        Using a
        <a title="White Easter Egg" href="https://wiki.torn.com/wiki/White_Easter_Egg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Easter Egg</a>
        which halves current drug addiction, although it does not appear to do the same to the rehab expense.

<p>
    More testing needs to be done before accurate figures can be set on how many of each drug will force an Education
    kick.
