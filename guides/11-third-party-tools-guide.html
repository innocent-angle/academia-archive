    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">TODO: Add a list of features for both tools, explain other scripts<br /></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    There are two very popular third party tools / apps that you might be interested in using. All of the tools below are
    safe, legal, and maintained by trusted Torn community members. I personally have used TornTools for years and can't
    even imagine playing the game without it at this point.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You must provide an <a href="/preferences.php#tab=api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API key</a> (limited, usually)
    when using most of these tools.
</p>
<p>It is the legal way apps and scripts can get information from the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">TornTools - Browser Extension</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Bunch of tools and quality of life improvements to the desktop / browser version of the game. Cannot be used on mobile
    as far as I know.

    <span style="font-size: 16px;">TornPDA - Mobile App<br /></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Similar to TornTools but is a separate mobile app. I haven't used it but I've heard its very useful for mobile
    players.

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">TornStats - Website</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has a bunch of data &amp; stats, a few simulators. Mostly used by factions to share stat spies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">YATA - Website &amp; Discord Bot</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to TornStats, has a Discord bot with some useful features, which we have on our server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I don't play on mobile so I can't say much about it, I've heard it's very similar to TornStats and most mobile players
    use it.
