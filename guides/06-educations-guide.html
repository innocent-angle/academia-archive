</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Education is somewhat controversial in Torn, hardly anyone can agree on what order to take them in. Here I will
    outline some that I think everyone should consider first, and then I'll give you some to think about depending on your
    goals. Eventually you should take them all.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The education merits are highly recommended, check our merit guide as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good general starting order for everyone:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Intravenous Therapy is widely regarded as the most important education course. It gives you access to the most
    efficient medical items in the game, and allows you to hospitalize yourself by using the wrong blood type. It is also
    greatly appreciated if you fill empty blood bags in the armory to help cut costs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point you should really create your own plan. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you want to run a company some day?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    If so, I recommend doing some research into what it takes to lead a company. It isn't as hard as people make it out to
    be, but it does require you to be active almost every single day and put some effort into recruiting. If you are okay
    with all of this, start doing all of the business education right away, they are one of the best investments in the
    game.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you want a boost to all future education course work stat gains?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Completing the general education bachelor gives you a permanent 10% boost to work stat gains from education. This
    might be worth it, but that can only be decided by you, as it will take you over a month to complete them which could
    also be spent on anything else.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Are you getting close to bootlegging?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a required education in the computer science category for setting up an online store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Are you getting close to the hacking crimes?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a required education in the computer science category that is required for hacking crimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">(Obsolete) Are you getting close to the driving crimes?&nbsp;</span></strong>
</p>
<p>Note: This was used for an old crime, but a future crime will likely require it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a required education in the general education category that is required for driving crimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you want to bust/bail people out of jail?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend completing all of the law crimes as they give a huge buff to these actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
