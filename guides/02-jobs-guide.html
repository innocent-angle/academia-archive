    <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Jobs Guide</span></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Jobs are very important in Torn as they give a wide range of benefits, from daily energy to millions of dollars. City
    Jobs offer up to 4 perks each, while player-owned jobs all give 5 perks each. Perks are not created equal, some are
    extremely valuable while some are completely worthless.

<p>
    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>City Jobs</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    City jobs are very useful and should be completed as early as possible, as they give permanent bonuses that you can
    keep after reaching the top rank of the job and moving on to player companies.

    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;">
        Medical - Permanently unlocks the ability to revive* other players at &lsquo;Brain Surgeon&rsquo; rank.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;">
        Education - Permanently gain 10% passive decrease in completion time for all future education.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;">
        Law - Permanently gain +5% in crime exp &amp; skill gain
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    * Reviving is a specialized role in Torn, it is highly recommended you move to a faction with revive perks if this is
    the route you want to take. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in reviving, you can skip the medical job entirely.

<p>
    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Player Owned Companies</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    After (or maybe before) getting the permanent unlocks from city jobs, you will probably want to move on to a player
    owned company. The perks are much better and some companies have rotating trains, which gives you more job stat growth
    in the long term. You gain one job point, per star, per day in these companies. There are too many to list all of them
    here, but I&rsquo;ll point out the commonly recommended ones and why:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Sweet Shops - Easiest to get into. Valuable job points can be traded for energy cans at 7 stars.</li>
    <li>Adult Novelties - Slightly harder to get into. Trades job points for eDVDs at 3 stars.</li>
    <li>Candle Shops - Trades job points for 5 energy each, can exchange up to 100 job points per day.</li>
    <li>Pubs - All 5 perks are good. Energy, nerve, and bonus melee damage.</li>
    <li>Music Stores - Gives a 30% bonus to gym experience at 3 stars.</li>
    <li>Strip Clubs - Two types, high requirements. For users focusing primarily on dexterity or defense.</li>
    <li>Fitness Centers - Mid to high requirements, best for all around gym gains.</li>
    <li>Private Security / Logistics / Mining Corps - Early/Mid game cash companies with decent perks.</li>
    <li>Oil Rigs - Highest requirements. "Final Boss" of cash companies with 2-3m/day worth of perks.</li>
    <li>Lingerie Stores - Very high requirements and often tax around 15m/week. Great travel perks though.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    * Always prioritize joining a company that rotates trains over companies that don&rsquo;t. Generally if a company
    earns less than 3m income per day (sweet shops, adult novelties, candle shops) it runs at a loss and is acceptable to
    sell the trains instead of rotating them, but there will still be some that run at a loss and rotate the trains.

    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>My advice</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Picking a job is pretty difficult, there is no best answer. If I were to restart all over, and all I wanted was money,
    I would probably join a sweet shop from day one and stay there until I had the requirements to complete each city job.
    After completing each city job I would move on to an adult novelty company. Once I have about 50,000+ in a stat, I
    would start fishing for better offers at PSFs, Mines, Logis, or maybe even an oil rig. At 100,000 in a stat I would
    try to find a 10 star oil rig.
