    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-green);">TLDR: Just attack anyone while the chain is active. if you're able to stick around for a while, it's better to
        space your hits out to make the chain last longer, otherwise it's okay to just make all your hits at once. Don't sit
        on a full stack though, burn your energy down to a point where you can regenerate some.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Chains begin with a 5 minute "warm up period" in which 10 attacks must be made. After 10 attacks are made, a timer
    begins counting down from 5 minutes. Every successful attack within the timer increases the chain count by one, resets
    the timer, and increases the respect multiplier for future attacks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You must be a full member (not a recruit) in order for hits to count towards the chain. Once a chain ends, another
    chain can't begin until the chain cooldown ends, which increases with chain length. There are respect bonuses for
    reaching certain chain counts as outlined below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    The goal of chains is mostly just to hang out and earn respect for upgrades, and also see how far we can go. Our
    highest chain is displayed on our faction for all to see, so it is kind of a badge of honor. There's nothing
    competitive about them in our case, and it's not a big deal when the chain inevitably drops.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You can stack energy to 1000 using Xanax, by draining your energy to 0, taking a Xanax, waiting out the cooldown to
    take another, and so on. Most players will start stacking 2 days before an event in case of an overdose and to let
    their cooldown wear off to take a 5th xanax after using their stack. Stacking isn't required for our optional chains,
    but does help if you want to.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A point refill can be used once a day to refill your energy bar.</li>
    <li>The MCS stock provides 100 energy per level.</li>
    <li>Energy cans &amp; feather hotel coupons can be used to gain energy &amp; increase your booster cooldown.</li>
    <li>Some companies perks give energy, such as candle shops, pubs and farms.</li>
    <li>Green easter eggs found during the Easter event give 500 energy per egg.</li>
    <li>Torn's seasonal newsletters can give you 250 energy. You get these in your email once per season.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Strategy &amp; The Process</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">Note:</span> The purpose and strategy of chains is different during
    wars. This strategy is for our optional chains.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Chaining is very simple for the most part, all you have to do is hit a target, it can be anyone and they don't have to
    be in a faction. Chains often start very strong, but get more difficult over time as people begin to run out of
    energy, go to bed, etc. Most of our chains will only last a few hours up to a day. if you're able to stick around for
    a while, it's better to space your hits out to make the chain last longer, otherwise it's okay to just make all your
    hits at once.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    If a chain is to last more than a few hours, it is customary to assign "chain watchers" by the hour. As a chain
    watcher it is your duty to watch the chain and make sure it stays alive, spacing your attacks out by waiting until the
    timer is down to about a minute and a half. We usually won't need chain watchers, but if we do a spreadsheet will be
    created to keep track, and volunteers would be paid.
