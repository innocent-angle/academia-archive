<p>
    Flying is a very stable money maker accessible from level 15, and the first goal of most new players. Every location
    you can fly to has items you can buy, some are profitable but not all are. Plushies and flowers are most commonly
    bought. Some locations also have activities you can do, such as rehabilitation in Switzerland to get rid of drug
    addiction, or hunting in South Africa.

    If you use TornTools (on PC) or TornPDA (on mobile) you should be able to see item profits before you travel. For
    TornTools, it is below the travel screen. TornPDA has a "Foreign Stock" menu. Make sure you factor in your energy
    regeneration, if you take a very long flight you will probably waste some, you have to decide if that's worth it for
    you or not. If you can't use either of those tools,&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://yata.yt/bazaar/abroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yata.yt</a>
    is a website that has this stock/profit data as well.

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;">
        Buying/renting a private island and an airstrip, increases max items per trip by 15.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;">
        Faction upgrades increase items per trip by up to 10 (we have all 10 upgrades).
    </li>
    <li>The large suitcase adds 4 more items per trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Make sure you hire a pilot or your airstrip won't work!</em></p>
<p><em>Make sure you select the airstrip instead of standard in the flying menu!</em></p>

    <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Renting vs Buying a Private Island</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early in the game, before you have a 2b bank and a few stock blocks, renting is much more efficient.</p>
<p>
    Once you have a solid income and are comfortable, you can consider and decide for yourself when to buy your own
    island.

<p>
    <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Are travel item jobs worth it?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Probably not. If you're very efficient and flying all hours of the day, a lingerie store might be worth it for you.
    Plushie/Flower prices fluctuate, so you really just have to do the math yourself and decide for yourself.
