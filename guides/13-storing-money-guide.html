    <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Storing Money</strong></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Piggy Bank (new players only)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    During your first week, you may have a piggy bank available under your missions to buy with mission credits. You can
    put an unlimited(?) amount of money in it, but can only withdraw the money once, by breaking it. It then becomes
    unusable. Consider grabbing it even if you won't use it, since it's cheap and can't be obtained again in the future.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Faction Vault (safe but not convenient)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You can store money in our faction vault, but we don't necessarily recommend it. It's not meant to be convenient, as
    you can't withdraw it yourself, it has to be sent to you on request. The preferred way to request money is to ping the
    @banker role in Discord in the banking channel, but if you can't join Discord just message me and I'll try to get it
    to you when it's safe.

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Stock Market (recommended)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    By buying a stock ticker from the points market, you gain access to the stock market. You can store an unlimited
    amount of money here, but <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">there is a 0.1% fee for withdrawing</span>.
    This is the ideal way to store money long term, as the benefit blocks huge chunks of passive income, such as SYM
    offering ~70% yearly ROI. Stocks also, on average, increase 10% yearly (spread across all stocks, not individually) so
    having many stock blocks is excellent.

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Ghost Trades (recommended, has risks)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    By starting a trade with someone who has been online in the last 6 hours, you can store an unlimited(?) amount of
    money in the trade for up to 6 hours. Make sure you withdraw the money and properly store it, because
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">this trade will expire after 6 hours and any money inside will go back into your hand</span>. A few people use me,
    <a href="/profiles.php?XID=2068379" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: var(--te-text-color-blue);">Cute</span></a>, for ghost trades and you're welcome to as well. Only do this
    with people you trust, as
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">the </span><span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">other player could cancel the trade early and mug you</span>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Company Vault (recommended, has risks)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Company vaults are in my opinion the most convenient way to store money, but obviously you have to be director of a
    company. Some players buy cheap companies and don't actually run them, just to use this feature.
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">If you don't own the SYS stock, your company can be hacked and lose 1-3% of funds</span>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Private Island&nbsp;Vault (recommended, limit 1b)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Pretty simple, if you own a private island with a vault, you can store money in it. Probably the safest way to store
    money overall, but you can only store up to 1b if you have the largest size vault.
    <span style="color: var(--te-text-color-red);">Do not enable spouse vault sharing unless you trust your spouse</span>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Cayman Islands (terrible)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You can travel to the Cayman Islands and store your money there, but it's generally a terrible idea. People are always
    camped out there mugging, at some point no matter how careful you are you will slip up and get mugged. It's not great
    long term either, the interest rate is 0.5% monthly, which is less yearly than the stock market on average.
